# Green Stocks Analysis

Project Overview
----------------

The purpose of this analysis was to take a look at green energy stock performance for possible investment. 

Results
-------

Based solely on the volume and return information for 2017 and 2018, ENPH and RUN would be recommended investments as both showed an increase in volume from 2017 to 2018 and maintained a positive return in 2018 when all other stocks showed negative returns. RUN, specifically, seems to be very promising - there was an 88% increase in trade volume and return increased by 78.4 percentage points YoY. Steve's family invested only in DQ and although they had the highest return in 2017, among the 12 stocks we analyzed, it was amongst the worst performers in 2018. Below is a side-by-side comparison of the stock performance:

Upon refactoring of the code, I was able to reduce runtime by more than 70%.

Summary
-------

Overall, refactoring code can make it run more efficiently which is especially important when analyzing large data sets. This analysis only took a look at 12 stocks and 2 years worth of performance data - increasing this data set would certainly require a more efficient code in order to gain timely insights into possible investments. In refactoring, you are changing the structure and organization of the code, however, you are not making any changes to the output and there is the possibilty of introducing bugs that you may not catch.
